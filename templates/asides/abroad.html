                    I studied abroad in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Andalusia" target="_blank">Cordoba, Spain</a>
                    spring semester of 2016. It was an amazing experience. I lived with a Spanish family who only didn't speak any English, and two
                    of my classes were taught in Spanish. The history of Cordoba is pretty amazing - in fact, my backyard had a 600 year old
                    Muslim wall, and a 2,000 year old Roman column in it.

                    I decided to stay in Europe that summer. I traveled up through Portugal, then through northern Spain, then I flew
                    to Sweden to visit a friend. The two of us flew to Iceland where we rented a car and camped for 8 days.
                    From there I flew to Prague and worked my way south through Budapest, Belgrade, Kosovo, until I hit
                    the Greek islands.
